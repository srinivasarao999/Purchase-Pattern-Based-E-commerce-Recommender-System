The project includes the following key steps:
1. Data Loading: Importing and preprocessing the dataset.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
3. Modeling: Implementing collaborative filtering and content-based filtering models.
4. Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models.
5. Prediction: Generating recommendations for users.
